# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM

This project utilizes stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict and forecast stock market prices. LSTM networks are particularly effective for time series forecasting tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The dataset typically includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc. Using this data, the model learns to predict future price movements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook 


## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of stacked LSTM layers followed by one or more dense layers. Stacking LSTM layers helps the model learn more complex patterns in the data. The final layer typically outputs the predicted stock prices.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
4. Run the notebook cells to train the model and evaluate its performance.
5. Optionally, tweak hyperparameters or experiment with different architectures to improve performance.

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), etc. Visualization techniques such as plotting actual vs. predicted prices can also provide insights into the model's performance.

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with different LSTM architectures (e.g., bidirectional LSTM, stacked GRU) to improve performance.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful features from the data.
- Implement advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms or ensemble learning for better predictions.
